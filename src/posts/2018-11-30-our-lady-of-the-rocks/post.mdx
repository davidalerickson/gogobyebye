Our morning view from our AirBnb is of Kotor Bay and two islets, one of which has a small church built on it known as “Our Lady or the Rocks.” Legend has it that, on July 22, 1452, two fisherman found a painting of the Madonna and Child on a rock in the Bay of Kotor. This “miraculous” event inspired seamen to place rocks at the site after each successful voyage. Decrepit ships were filled with rocks and also sunk at this site. Eventually an artificial island rose from the sea and the church was built on this spot, where mariners could leave their offerings. These offerings appear in the church and in a museum on the church grounds. Well worth a visit. The history is interesting and the views are spectacular.
