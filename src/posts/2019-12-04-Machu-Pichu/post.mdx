When planing our current trip to South America we always envisioned Machu Pichu as being the highlight of the trip, as it turned out to be. From the train from Cusco to Aguas Calientes and passing the day there before our ascent, everything led to an almost spiritual peak. The day started rainy and misty, and we thought that we might be able to see very nuch, but after about an hour the skys cleared and revealed the majestic ruins and landscape in all of it's glory. First we walked aound ourselves, but then joined up with a guide who spoke Portuguese and really learned of the history, construction and mythology of Machu Pichu and the region. I would recommend that if you go, that you do the same. It was quite nice to be by ourselves in the beginning, but the guide made the experience much more real. He also was a crack photographer recorded some great memories for us.
