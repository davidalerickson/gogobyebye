RV Travels had long been a dream of ours.

For the past few years I have wanted to get an RV and travel the country. During this time, my poor wife Carmela has put up with me calling her over to my computer screen to look at “one more motor home.” Finally, she too caught the fever. After criss-crossing Florida looking for our new home we found one in our back yard at Lazydays RV in Tampa.
