The strangely named Reggae Bar on Phi Phi Island, in Thailand, has a Thai Boxing ring which hosts fights between Thai Boxers as well as between foreigners who volunteer to fight. The prize is a bucket of drinks. An extremely drunk boxer, Russian I think, at first fights pretty well, but thenâ€¦just watch.
