Topsail Hill Preserve State Park is a 1,640-acre Florida State Park located in Santa Rosa Beach, ten miles east of Destin, off U.S. 98, in northwestern Florida. 

Probably the best Florida State Park we have been to yet. Situated on the Florida Panhandle, Topsail Hill Reserve State Park has the beach, lake and many trails as well as a great infrastructure, including a coffee shop. Be patient and watch the video since, about a minute in, I have drone footage of Santa Rosa Beach that will make you beach lovers and would be snowbirds hop in your cars and hightail it down here.
