Three Sisters Spings is the winter home for hundreds of manatees. The day we were there the resident biologists counted 175. I just know there were a lot. Three Sisters is unique in that you may get very close to the manatees and me even touch them if they approach you, which is almost guaranteed as they are very curious and friendly. There is a park ranger in a canoe to make sure you do not chase or molest them. There is even signage saying that it is prohibited to ride them. This must have happened in the past. Go figure. All I would like to do is give one a big squeeze, but I resisted the urge.
